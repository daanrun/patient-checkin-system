# 🐙 GitHub Repository Setup

## Quick Setup for Backend Deployment

Since Railway and other services deploy from GitHub, here's how to get your code online:

### Option 1: GitHub Desktop (Easiest)

1. **Download GitHub Desktop**
   - Go to: https://desktop.github.com
   - Install and sign in to GitHub

2. **Create Repository**
   - Click "Create a New Repository on your hard drive"
   - Name: `patient-checkin-system`
   - Local path: Choose your project folder
   - Click "Create Repository"

3. **Publish to GitHub**
   - Click "Publish repository"
   - Uncheck "Keep this code private" (or keep private if preferred)
   - Click "Publish Repository"

### Option 2: GitHub Web Interface

1. **Create New Repository**
   - Go to: https://github.com/new
   - Repository name: `patient-checkin-system`
   - Description: `Professional patient check-in system with React frontend and Node.js backend`
   - Click "Create repository"

2. **Upload Files**
   - Click "uploading an existing file"
   - Drag and drop your entire project folder
   - Commit message: "Initial commit - Patient check-in system"
   - Click "Commit changes"

### Option 3: Command Line (If you have Git configured)

```bash
# Create repository on GitHub first, then:
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/patient-checkin-system.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## ✅ Once on GitHub

Your repository will be at:
`https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/patient-checkin-system`

Then you can:
1. Deploy backend to Railway/Render using the GitHub repo
2. Set root directory to `backend/`
3. Add environment variables
4. Connect to your live frontend!

## 🚀 Repository Structure

Your GitHub repo will contain:
```
patient-checkin-system/
├── frontend/          # React app (already deployed to Netlify)
├── backend/           # Node.js API (ready for Railway)
├── netlify.toml       # Netlify configuration
├── DEPLOYMENT.md      # Deployment guide
├── README.md          # Documentation
└── package.json       # Root package file
```

**Perfect for deployment to any cloud service!**
